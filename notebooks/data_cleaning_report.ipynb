    "\n",
    "This report describes the data cleaning steps applied to the customer dataset to ensure accuracy, consistency, and usability.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1. Duplicated Rows\n",
    "The dataset was checked for duplicated rows. Any duplicates found were removed to ensure that each customer entry is unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Standardizing Text Columns\n",
    "Text columns, including First Name, Last Name, Company, City, and Country, were standardized to **Title Case**. This ensures uniform capitalization across all entries, improving readability and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Normalizing Phone Numbers\n",
    "Phone numbers in both Phone 1 and Phone 2 columns were cleaned and standardized. Extensions were separated where applicable, and all numbers were formatted into a consistent national format. This ensures accurate contact information and easier processing for any downstream applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Subscription Date Formatting\n",
    "The Subscription Date column was converted to a consistent **DD-MM-YYYY** format. Any invalid dates were identified and corrected where possible. This standardization ensures uniformity across all date entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Handling Missing Values\n",
    "Missing values were handled as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Country:** Any missing country values were filled with `\"Unknown\"` to indicate missing information while retaining the row.  \n",
    "- **Website:** Missing website values were filled with `\"Not Available\"` to clearly indicate absence of data.  \n",
    "- **Customer Id:** Rows missing a Customer Id were dropped, as this is a critical identifier and necessary for maintaining dataset integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "After cleaning, the dataset is now:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Free of duplicate rows  \n",
    "- Text columns are uniformly capitalized  \n",
    "- Phone numbers are standardized and extensions are separated  \n",
    "- Subscription dates are consistently formatted  \n",
    "- Missing values have been appropriately addressed  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is now ready for analysis, reporting, or export to other systems.\n"
